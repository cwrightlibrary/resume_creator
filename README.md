# 📄 Resume Creator
An iOS (maybe Android) app, where you chat with an AI bot for a bit to generate each job and education description as well as generate a job-focused cover-letter.

Upon exporting, the user will get a PDF resume/cover letter combo in a style that they chose, and which is also 100% compatible with any online job application (basically meaning, the site will rip the information correctly every time they upload so they don't have to type everything back into the app site).

Ideally, I want the app to export a *.docx* version of the resume/cover letter (with the fonts embedded) as well as a *.pdf*, but it seems that Swift might be limited here.

## 🎨 App Icon Ideas
I want the design of the app icon to be more along the lines of a macOS icon: realistic objects, friendly gradients, etc.

The following emojis were suggested by ChatGPT when asking it to give me emojis that have to do with *"resume"*, *cover letter*, or *job application*:

#### Cover Letter:
- 💌 (Love Letter emoji) - Symbolizes the personal touch and care put into a cover letter.
- 📝 (Pen emoji) - Represents the writing aspect of composing a cover letter.

#### Job Application:
- 📋 (Clipboard emoji) - Represents the application form or the process of filling out details.
